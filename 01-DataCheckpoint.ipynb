    "How have housing prices and affordability changed over time in regions surrounding University of California (UC) campuses, and how do these trends relate to local income levels and broader economic conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we examine whether housing prices near UC campuses have increased faster than median household income and how these trends differ across regions (e.g., Irvine, La Jolla, Berkeley, Los Angeles) and time periods. The main metrics are median home price (or home value index), median household income, and affordability (e.g., price-to-income ratio or rent burden). The analysis is primarily descriptive and comparative. We will visualize price and income trends, compare regions, and assess changes in affordability over at least 10 to 20 years using public data from government and real-estate sources (e.g., Zillow, U.S. Census/ACS, FRED).\n",

    "Housing affordability has become a major economic and social issue in California, particularly in regions with high demand and limited housing supply. Areas surrounding University of California campuses often experience additional housing pressure due to student populations, faculty demand, and local economic growth. Prior research has shown that housing prices in California have increased significantly over the past two decades, frequently outpacing wage growth and contributing to affordability challenges for renters and homeowners alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several public data sources provide context. Zillow's housing market reports document long-term growth in home values across major U.S. metropolitan areas, with especially rapid increases in coastal California cities. U.S. Census data and American Community Survey (ACS) reports provide evidence that median household income growth has been slower and uneven across regions. Our project focuses on UC-adjacent regions (e.g., Irvine, La Jolla, Berkeley, Los Angeles) and compares affordability trends across multiple campuses using Zillow, Census/ACS, and FRED data."

    "We hypothesize that housing prices in regions surrounding UC campuses have increased faster than median household income over time, leading to decreased affordability. We also expect that UC regions in major metropolitan or coastal areas (e.g., near UC Berkeley or UCLA) will exhibit higher prices and lower affordability compared to UC campuses in less dense regions (e.g., UC Riverside or UC Merced). This is based on prior evidence that coastal and urban California markets have seen stronger price growth and that university towns often face extra demand from students and staff, while income growth has been slower and uneven across the state.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Dataset 1: Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), Single-Family Residences**\n",
    "- **Dataset name:** Zip_Zhvi_SingleFamilyResidence (ZIP code level, single-family home values).\n",
    "- **Link:** [Zillow Research Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). For this checkpoint we use a public mirror: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noahgift/real_estate_ml/master/data/Zip_Zhvi_SingleFamilyResidence_2018.csv`.\n",
    "- **Observations:** One row per ZIP code. Thousands of ZIPs nationally; we filter to California and further to UC-adjacent areas.\n",
    "- **Variables:** RegionID, RegionName (ZIP), State, Metro, CountyName, and many date columns (e.g., 1996-04 to 2018-08) with typical home value in dollars for that month. We use RegionName/State/CountyName for geography and the date columns for price levels and trends over time.\n",
    "- **Relevance:** Provides housing price levels and growth over time at fine geography (ZIP). We can aggregate to county or metro and align with UC campus regions (e.g., Irvine, La Jolla, Berkeley, Los Angeles).\n",
    "- **Shortcomings:** Data end in 2018 in this mirror. Official Zillow data are updated monthly. Geography is ZIP, so we must map ZIPs to counties/metros for UC regions. Single-family only (excludes condos).\n",

    "**Dataset 2: California Income Limits by County**\n",
    "- **Dataset name:** 2022 Income Limits by County (California Open Data).\n",
    "- **Link:** [data.ca.gov – Income Limits by County](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/income-limits-by-county). Direct CSV: `https://data.ca.gov/dataset/.../download/2022-income-limits.csv`.\n",
    "- **Observations:** One row per county (and household size / income limit type). Covers all 58 California counties.\n",
    "- **Variables:** County name, income limit categories (e.g., median income, low-income limits by household size). We use county and median (or comparable) income for comparison with housing prices.\n",
    "- **Relevance:** Gives county-level income measures for California so we can compare income and housing prices by region (e.g., Orange County for Irvine, San Diego for La Jolla, Alameda for Berkeley).\n",
    "- **Shortcomings:** Income limits are program-related (e.g., HUD) and m\n",

    "**Combining the datasets:** We will join on geography. Zillow data have CountyName; income data have county. We will filter Zillow to California, aggregate or select ZIPs for UC-adjacent counties (e.g., Orange, San Diego, Alameda, Los Angeles), and merge with county-level income. For time series we use Zillow date columns and, when available, multi-year income data (e.g., from Census ACS) for the same counties.\n",

It contains county-level estimates of **median household income measured in U.S. dollars (USD)**. Each row represents one county observation per year. The key variable is median household income, which represents the midpoint of the household income distribution within a county. This means half of households earn more than the median income and half earn less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median household income is an important economic indicator because it reflects the general income level and economic well-being of residents in a geographic region. Higher median income values typically indicate greater economic resources available to households, while lower values may reflect economic disadvantage or limited employment opportunities. Because the ACS provides standardized estimates across counties, this dataset allows comparison of income levels across regions and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concerns.** (1) ACS values are estimates derived from survey sampling rather than complete administrative records, so there may be sampling error or uncertainty in the reported values. (2) Median household income does not capture income inequality within a county. (3) The dataset does not account for differences in cost of living across regions, which may affect comparability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining with Zillow.** Zillow ZHVI data are aggregated at the ZIP level, while ACS income data are at the county level. We will merge datasets using county name (or FIPS if available) so each county has both a housing value measure and a corresponding income measure.

    "American Community Survey (ACS) — Median Household Income\n",
    "This dataset comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, Table B19013, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It contains county-level estimates of median household income measured in U.S. dollars. Each row represents a county observation, and the key variable is median household income, which represents the midpoint of household income distribution within a county. This means half of households earn more than the median income and half earn less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median household income is an important economic indicator because it reflects the general income level and economic well-being of residents in a geographic region. Higher median income values typically indicate greater economic resources available to households, while lower values may reflect economic disadvantage or limited employment opportunities. Because the ACS provides standardized estimates across counties, this dataset allows comparison of income levels across regions and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this dataset is that ACS values are estimates derived from survey sampling rather than complete administrative records. As a result, there may be sampling error or uncertainty in the reported values. Additionally, median household income does not capture income inequality within a county and does not account for differences in cost of living across regions."
