    "\n",
    "This dataset comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, Table B19013, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It contains county-level estimates of median household income measured in U.S. dollars. Each row represents a county observation, and the key variable is median household income, which represents the midpoint of household income distribution within a county. This means half of households earn more than the median income and half earn less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median household income is an important economic indicator because it reflects the general income level and economic well-being of residents in a geographic region. Higher median income values typically indicate greater economic resources available to households, while lower values may reflect economic disadvantage or limited employment opportunities. Because the ACS provides standardized estimates across counties, this dataset allows comparison of income levels across regions and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this dataset is that ACS values are estimates derived from survey sampling rather than complete administrative records. As a result, there may be sampling error or uncertainty in the reported values. Additionally, median household income does not capture income inequality within a county and does not account for differences in cost of living across regions."
