        "Specifically, we examine whether housing prices near UC campuses have increased faster than median household income and how these trends differ across regions (e.g., Irvine, La Jolla, Berkeley, Los Angeles) and time periods. The main metrics are median home price (or home value index), median household income, and affordability (e.g., price-to-income ratio or rent burden). The analysis is primarily descriptive and comparative. We will visualize price and income trends, compare regions, and assess changes in affordability over at least 10 to 20 years using public data from government and real-estate sources (e.g., Zillow, U.S. Census/ACS, FRED).\n",

Areas surrounding University of California campuses often experience additional housing pressure due to student populations, faculty demand, and local economic growth. Prior research has shown that housing prices in California have increased significantly over the past two decades, frequently outpacing wage growth and contributing to affordability challenges for renters and homeowners alike.\n",
