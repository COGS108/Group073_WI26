        "Specifically, we examine whether housing prices near UC campuses have increased faster than median household income and how these trends differ across regions (e.g., Irvine, La Jolla, Berkeley, Los Angeles) and time periods. The main metrics are median home price (or home value index), median household income, and affordability (e.g., price-to-income ratio or rent burden). The analysis is primarily descriptive and comparative. We will visualize price and income trends, compare regions, and assess changes in affordability over at least 10 to 20 years using public data from government and real-estate sources (e.g., Zillow, U.S. Census/ACS, FRED).\n",

        "We hypothesize that housing prices in regions surrounding UC campuses have increased faster than median household income over time, leading to decreased affordability. We also expect that UC regions located in major metropolitan or coastal areas (e.g., near UC Berkeley or UCLA) will exhibit higher prices and lower affordability compared to UC campuses in less dense regions (e.g., UC Riverside or UC Merced). This is based on prior evidence that coastal and urban California markets have seen stronger price growth and that university towns often face extra demand from students and staff, while income growth has been slower and uneven across the state."
