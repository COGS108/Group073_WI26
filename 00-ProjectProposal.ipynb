        "We hypothesize that housing prices in regions surrounding UC campuses have increased faster than median household income over time, leading to decreased affordability. We also expect that UC regions located in major metropolitan or coastal areas (e.g., near UC Berkeley or UCLA) will exhibit higher prices and lower affordability compared to UC campuses in less dense regions (e.g., UC Riverside or UC Merced). This is based on prior evidence that coastal and urban California markets have seen stronger price growth and that university towns often face extra demand from students and staff, while income growth has been slower and uneven across the state."
